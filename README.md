# Vue Blog

This project is a blog application created using Vue.js. Users can add new blog posts, view existing posts, and search through categories.

The project uses Firebase Realtime Database to store and manage blog data. Each new post is added along with the selected category and author information. Additionally, blog titles are styled with a custom Vue directive called v-rainbow that applies a random color.

### Project Features:

- **Add New Blog Posts:** Users can add a new blog post by entering a title, content, categories, and author.
- **Blog Post Preview:** Users can preview the title, content, and categories before submitting the post.
- **View Blog Posts:** Users can view all blog posts and navigate to details by clicking on the title.
- **Search Feature:** Users can search through blog titles.
- **Vue.js Features:** This project uses Vue.js data binding, computed properties, and event handling to create a dynamic and user-friendly interface.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** Vue.js, Vue Router, Vue Directives (v-rainbow), Fetch API
- **Backend:** Firebase Realtime Database
